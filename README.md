# Smart Healthcare: RL-Based Task Offloading Scheme for Edge-Enable Sensor Networks

This paper proposes Computation Offloading using ReinforcementLearning (CORL) scheme to minimize latency and energy consumption. We first formulate the problem as a combined latency and energy cost minimization problem, satisfying the lack of limited battery capacity and service latency deadline constraints. Moreover, proposed algorithm search optimal available resources node to offload task towards the trade-off between energy and latency. The experimental results show the benefits of the proposed scheme in terms of saving energy, minimizing latency, and maximum utilization of node resources in edge-enabled sensor networks. We are using an iFogSim simulator to validate the proposed scheme under realistic assumptions.
